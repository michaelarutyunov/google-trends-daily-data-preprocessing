PHASE 3 COMPLETION SUMMARY
==========================

Search Term: flu vaccine
Date Range: 2022-05-15 to 2025-08-07
Recommended Method: SMOOTH_ALPHA

PHASE 3 COMPLETION CRITERIA:
============================

PRIMARY METRICS (Scale-Invariant Validation):
---------------------------------------------
  Weekly Correlation ≥ 0.90:  ✓ PASS (achieved: 0.954)
  Weekly NMAE < 0.50:         ✓ PASS (achieved: 0.336)

SECONDARY METRICS (Context):
----------------------------
  Weekly Bias % < 20%:        ✓ PASS (achieved: 11.4%)
  Weekly MAE < 0.50:          ✓ PASS (achieved: 0.31)
  Monthly MAE < 3.0:          ✓ PASS (achieved: 2.65)

DIAGNOSTIC METRICS:
------------------
  Temporal CV NMAE gap < 0.10: ✓ EXCELLENT (achieved: -0.112)
  Method exported:             ✓ PASS

OVERALL STATUS: ✓✓✓ ALL PRIMARY TARGETS EXCEEDED ✓✓✓

DELIVERABLES:
=============

✓ Robustness Testing:
  - Overlap sensitivity: [30, 60, 90, 133]
  - Weight sensitivity: [0.3, 0.5, 0.7]
  - Results: reports/overlap_sensitivity.png, reports/weight_sensitivity.png

✓ Temporal Cross-Validation:
  - Configuration: 24m train, 3m gap, 6m test
  - Methods tested: 4
  - Results: reports/temporal_cv_comparison.png, reports/temporal_cv_results.csv

✓ Final Method Comparison:
  - Methods compared: 4
  - Selection criteria: NMAE + Correlation (scale-invariant)
  - Final report: reports/final_recommendation.txt

✓ Production Export:
  - Method: smooth_alpha
  - Formats: Parquet + CSV
  - Location: results/smooth_alpha_final.{parquet,csv}
  - Metadata: results/smooth_alpha_metadata.csv

METHOD COMPARISON SUMMARY:
=========================

Baseline:        Corr 0.906, NMAE 0.803 → Reference only
Hierarchical:    Corr 0.954, NMAE 0.337 → Strong performance
Hierarchical+DOW: Corr 0.953, NMAE 0.362 → Similar to hierarchical
Smooth Alpha:    Corr 0.954, NMAE 0.336 → ⭐ RECOMMENDED (best NMAE)

WHY SMOOTH ALPHA WON:
- Best NMAE (0.336 vs 0.337 for hierarchical)
- Excellent correlation (0.954, exceeds 0.90 target)
- Low bias (11.4%, well below 20% target)
- Excellent temporal CV generalization (NMAE gap: -0.112)

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Review final recommendation: reports/final_recommendation.txt
2. Use stitched data for forecasting: results/smooth_alpha_final.parquet
3. For new search term: Edit config.yaml, rerun notebooks 01-10
4. Alternative method: Use hierarchical if cvxpy not available (nearly identical)

METRIC INTERPRETATION:
=====================

Your stitched daily data achieves:
  → 0.954 correlation with weekly ground truth (pattern preservation)
  → 33.6% average error relative to mean (scale-invariant accuracy)
  → 0.31 absolute error in Google Trends index points (context)

This validates the stitching approach and confirms the data is suitable for
downstream forecasting or nowcasting applications.
