PHASE 3 COMPLETION SUMMARY
==========================

✓ Robustness Testing:
  - Overlap sensitivity tested: [30, 60, 90, 133]
  - Weight sensitivity tested: [0.3, 0.5, 0.7]
  - Results: See reports/overlap_sensitivity.png and reports/weight_sensitivity.png

✓ Temporal Cross-Validation:
  - Configuration: 24 months train, 3 months gap, 6 months test
  - Methods tested: 5
  - Results: See reports/temporal_cv_comparison.png

✓ Final Method Comparison:
  - Methods compared: 5 (baseline, hierarchical, hierarchical_dow, smooth_alpha, state_space)
  - Primary metric: Weekly MAE (independent validation)
  - Recommended method: SMOOTH_ALPHA

✓ Production Export:
  - Method: smooth_alpha
  - Formats: Parquet, CSV
  - Location: results/

PHASE 3 CRITERIA:
-----------------
  Weekly MAE < 1.5: ✓ PASS
  Monthly MAE < 3.0: ✓ PASS
  Temporal CV < 2% gap: ✓ PASS
  Method exported: ✓ PASS

METHOD SUMMARY:
---------------
  Baseline: Reference implementation, circular validation
  Hierarchical: Best overall performance ⭐
  Hierarchical+DOW: Degraded by renormalization
  Smooth Alpha: Similar to hierarchical, smoother alphas (requires cvxpy)
  State-Space: Adds uncertainty quantification (requires statsmodels)

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Review final recommendation in reports/final_recommendation.txt
2. Use exported series from results/smooth_alpha_final.parquet for forecasting
3. To analyze different search term: Edit config.yaml and rerun all notebooks
4. Consider smooth_alpha if you need alpha stability > accuracy
5. Consider state_space if you need confidence intervals for forecasting

✓ PHASE 3 COMPLETE!
