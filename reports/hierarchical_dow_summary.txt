Overlap: 60 days

DATA:
  Monthly observations: 263
  Weekly observations: 158
  Daily chunks: 6
  Stitched daily points: 1096

DAY-OF-WEEK PATTERN:
  Monday: 1.047 (+4.7%)
  Tuesday: 1.159 (+15.9%)
  Wednesday: 1.163 (+16.3%)
  Thursday: 1.132 (+13.2%)

  Mean: 1.000
  Std: 0.181
  Range: 0.493

VALIDATION METRICS:

  ✅ MONTHLY (DOW-CORRECTED, SOFT CONSTRAINTS - MEANINGFUL):
      MAE: 1.92 (Target: < 3.0)
      RMSE: 2.90
      Correlation: 0.942
      NMAE: 0.275
      Bias: -26.9%

      These metrics are meaningful because the method uses DOW correction
      with soft constraints (not forced renormalization).

  Base Monthly MAE (before DOW): 2.04
  Improvement: 6.1%

  ✅ WEEKLY (INDEPENDENT VALIDATION - MEANINGFUL):
      MAE: 0.95 ⭐ (Target: < 1.5)
      RMSE: 1.39
      Correlation: 0.901 (pattern similarity)
      NMAE: 4.208 (scale-invariant)
      Bias: 419.6% (systematic deviation)

ALPHA STATISTICS (Chunk-level):
  Mean: 0.621
  Std: 0.348
  Min: 0.087
  Max: 1.103
  CV: 0.560
