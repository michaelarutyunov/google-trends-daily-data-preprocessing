Search Term: flu vaccine
Date Range: 2022-01-01 to 2024-12-31
Overlap: 60 days

DATA:
  Monthly observations: 263
  Weekly observations: 158
  Daily chunks: 6
  Stitched daily points: 1096

DAY-OF-WEEK PATTERN:
  Monday: 1.163 (+16.3%)
  Tuesday: 1.194 (+19.4%)
  Wednesday: 1.286 (+28.6%)
  Thursday: 1.197 (+19.7%)
  Friday: 1.031 (+3.1%)
  Saturday: 0.672 (-32.8%)
  Sunday: 0.457 (-54.3%)

  Mean: 1.000
  Std: 0.290
  Range: 0.829

VALIDATION METRICS:

  ✅ MONTHLY (DOW-CORRECTED, SOFT CONSTRAINTS - MEANINGFUL):
      MAE: 2.75 (Target: < 3.0)
      RMSE: 3.39
      Correlation: 0.937
      NMAE: 0.395
      Bias: -37.4%

      These metrics are meaningful because the method uses DOW correction
      with soft constraints (not forced renormalization).

  Base Monthly MAE (before DOW): 2.92
  Improvement: 5.8%

  ✅ WEEKLY (INDEPENDENT VALIDATION - MEANINGFUL):
      MAE: 0.38 ⭐ (Target: < 1.5)
      RMSE: 0.67
      Correlation: 0.900 (pattern similarity)
      NMAE: 0.412 (scale-invariant)
      Bias: 9.2% (systematic deviation)

ALPHA STATISTICS (Chunk-level):
  Mean: 0.167
  Std: 0.136
  Min: 0.009
  Max: 0.387
  CV: 0.810
