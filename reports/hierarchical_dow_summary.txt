Overlap: 83 days

DATA:
  Monthly observations: 263
  Weekly observations: 169
  Daily chunks: 6
  Stitched daily points: 1181

DAY-OF-WEEK PATTERN:
  Monday: 1.134 (+13.4%)
  Tuesday: 1.202 (+20.2%)
  Wednesday: 1.291 (+29.1%)
  Thursday: 1.228 (+22.8%)

  Mean: 1.000
  Std: 0.297
  Range: 0.786

VALIDATION METRICS:

  ✅ MONTHLY (DOW-CORRECTED, SOFT CONSTRAINTS - MEANINGFUL):
      MAE: 2.56 (Target: < 3.0)
      RMSE: 3.04
      Correlation: 0.954
      NMAE: 0.376
      Bias: -33.6%

      These metrics are meaningful because the method uses DOW correction
      with soft constraints (not forced renormalization).

  Base Monthly MAE (before DOW): 2.65
  Improvement: 3.2%

  ✅ WEEKLY (INDEPENDENT VALIDATION - MEANINGFUL):
      MAE: 0.33 ⭐ (Target: < 1.5)
      RMSE: 0.62
      Correlation: 0.953 (pattern similarity)
      NMAE: 0.362 (scale-invariant)
      Bias: 17.8% (systematic deviation)

ALPHA STATISTICS (Chunk-level):
  Mean: 0.160
  Std: 0.119
  Min: 0.047
  Max: 0.369
  CV: 0.740
